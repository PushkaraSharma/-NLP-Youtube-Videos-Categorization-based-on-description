I didn‚Äôt realize until after we finished eating, but we didn‚Äôt eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!We started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It‚Äôs stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It‚Äôs sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It‚Äôs served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.The next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!Afterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!After this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!After this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.The addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha HutGali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I.

_AuXvnCLERA,    The Ultimate Indonesian Food Day Trip - HUGE Nasi Liwet Feast!  ,"‚ñ∫Check out my list of 50 incredible Indonesian foods: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...‚ñ∫Ken's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtMg...During my trip to Jakarta, I mostly remained in the city. But Ken and Gratiana from http://cowokrakus.com/ invited my wife Ying and I to go with them and their family on an Indonesian food trip to Bogor and the surrounding region (about an hour from Jakarta).Our first stop when we drove out of Jakarta and to Bogor was a famous place to eat Bogor style laksa at a restaurant called Laksa Bogor Pak Inin. It was exactly my kind of a restaurant, open air and local, with a wonderful friendly environment. The laksa was unlike any other laksa I‚Äôve ever had, and it was fantastic. Laksa Bogor - 10,000 IDR ($0.72)Next, we stopped at a place called Toge Goreng Pak Abung, which is another legendary Indonesian food stop in Bogor, Indonesia, and they are famous for serving a bean sprout snack. It was definitely a very interesting dish, including a mixture of bean sprouts and fermented soy beans. Toge Goreng - 7,000 IDR ($0.51)Next we drove into the beautiful Indonesian countryside and to the house. After having some Indonesian snacks and refreshing coconut, we then took a hike to go look for honey. The beekeeper was sick on the day we went, so we we‚Äôre able to get any honey, but it was still a beautiful hike.The highlight of this Indonesian food trip for me was the Sundanese style Nasi Liwet Botram family feast that we had. All the food was laid out on banana leaves, and we all sat and ate some of the most beautiful and flavorful Indonesian food. It was an incredible culinary experience.We drove back to Bogor and stopped at Warung Nasi Ampera to eat a quick dinner, and because I wanted to try some ikan pepes. The food was alright, but nothing compared to the lunch feast we had eaten! Total price - 103,000 IDR ($7.46) for 3 plates of foodFinally, back in Jakarta, we stopped near Manga Besar to have some desserts and to finish of this incredible day of Indonesian food. Sekoteng - 12,000 IDR ($0.87), Wedang Ronde - 12,000 IDR ($0.87)It was an incredible Indonesian food trip to the outskirts of Bogor, and a nice opportunity to get out of Jakarta for the day.A big thank you to Ken, Gratiana, and her family for inviting us to their house country house and for the amazing food.--KEN:Videos : https://www.youtube.com/c/cowokrakustubeBlog: http://cowokrakus.com/MY WEBSITES:Migrationology.com: http://migrationology.com/EatingThaiFood.com: http://eatingthaifood.com/TravelByYing.com: http://travelbyying.com/Camera I use: https://migrationology.com/travel-res...T-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/Get e-mail updates: https://migrationology.com/free-updatesSOCIAL MEDIA:Snapchat: @migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology‚ñ∫Jakarta Travel Guide: https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...‚ñ∫50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...--Thank you for watching this Indonesian food video!",food vlogs

rOAbYFdNQEo,"    The Ultimate DUBAI FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Emirati Cuisine in Dubai, UAE!  ","Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!Peyman‚Äôs Channel‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...Subscribe for 2 new videos per week‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeWhen I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.Price - 6 AED ($1.63) eachMachboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE.

We made our way to Hue in Central Vietnam in July 2017, and found a ton of different street food cuisine in Vietnam to try.

Since we love street food around the world, we decided that Vietnam was the perfect holiday destination for street food to try, because it's supposed to be the best and we love watching new street food recipes and street food flavors as we adventure down deep, back alleyways, getting lost into new street food worlds.  So far, in our Vietnamese street food tour series, we've eaten street food in Hanoi, and then we took the sleeper train south 12 hours to Hue. Hue is the old ancient capital of Vietnam, and is packed full of different street food to try. We spent 4 days here eating and couldn't get enough of all the street food. Asian street food is the best, and in Vietnam, it doesn't get any better!We found 11 different Vietnamese street foods in this video. If you arrive here looking to eat, you can follow along with these addresses:1) Bun Bo hue @02:44- The specialty street food Beef and pork broth noodle soup of Hue, Vietnam - It‚Äôs absolutely rich and delicious! Found at the Dong Ba market early morning around 730am. Go to the outside of the street market and find the old ladies with big pots of good street food and you‚Äôll discover a ton!2) Bun Hen @ 06:10 Spicy Clam noodle soup - Also found at the Dong Ba Market in Hue, Vietnam, in the early morning! Just look around the outside of the market, the perimeter, not on the inside.3) Banh Tam Banana Leaf @ 09:44 wrapped around marinated shrimp - Found directly beside the Bun Hen at Dong Ba market4) Veg Soup @ 11:27 - Also found at Dong Ba Street Food Market in Hue, Vietnam5) Bun Tith Nuong @ 14:37 Grilled pork over top of rice noodles. These was my favorite meal from Hue, and so cheap at 10,000 Vietnamese dong! Bun Thit Nuong 66 B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng6) Banh Mi Vietnamese Sandwich @ 17:55- This one was quite average. But still fun to eat! This one was at the intersection of Xuan 68 and Le Thanh Ton street inside Hue‚Äôs old city.7) Douhua Silken Tofu @ 21:27 - This was a street food vendor carrying the food on wooden poles, so you have to be lucky at the right place at the right time. We were at the location below around 4:30 PM and she came along.8) Banh Tran Truong ‚ÄúVietnamese Pizza made from rice paper‚Äù @ 22:54.

Z8deyiVL1-8,    Vile Parle East Street Food with SugarSpiceNice India  ,"Hello Hungryheads!Go subscribe to SugarSpiceNice India here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOsY...Go look for me on Shweta's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgEg-...--------------------------------------------------------In this food vlog, I took Shweta around Vile Parle East and enjoyed a ton of street food items that I have been eating since childhood. Filming this was like a trip down the memory lane for me. The first stop we made was at Sanmitra Dosa Centre. We opted for the Schezwan Cheese Onion Sada Dosa. Address: 55, Prabhat Cottage, Hanuman Road, Near Parle Tilak Vidyalaya, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057.We washed it down with a refreshing glass of sugarcane juice from a vendor right next to the dosa place. Next we went for a pizza toast sandwich, which used to be one of my favourites growing up accompanied by a black currant milkshake, which they call purple cow! You will get very many sandwich and juice options at Shree Annapurna. Address: Building plot no 23b, Shop No 1, Time Field Corporation, 2, Subhash Rd, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057After all that, we were pretty tired walking around, so we make a halt at Wagh Bakri Tea Lounge and called for their strong adrak-wali chai.Address: Ground Floor, Waman Co-Operative Housing Society, Hanuman Road, Opp. Paleshwar Mandir, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057There was no way we could miss chaat on a street food tour! So I took Shweta to my all time favourite Sharma Bhelpuri House. We both shared the lip smacking Sev Puri, Dahi Puri and Paani Puri.Address: Kamla Bhawan, Mahatma Gandhi Rd, Opp. Municipal Garnden, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057Before Shweta left for home, we decided to taste Aarey Lassi, which I drank after ages! It was not like it used be in its taste, packaging or price. --------------------------------------------------------------You can check out my other Mumbai food Vlogs too!Seafood Restaurants: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLYxc...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hJzd...-------------------------------------------------------------------You can buy my gear using my Amazon links:My Camera - https://amzn.to/2EnoNLTMy Mic - https://amzn.to/2CIPPvJVlogging Lens - https://amzn.to/2J112YQFollow me on Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/curlsbooksn...Write to me at : curlsbooksnbites@gmail.com",food vlogs

PVEeScXdSVU,    Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog  ,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!?

A3xHJzNNM2A,"    Street Food in Uzbekistan - 1,500 KG. of RICE PLOV (Pilau) + Market Tour in Tashkent!  ","‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you to B. Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZWRavshan‚Äôs Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...Uzbekistan Day 1: TashkentOn Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / GreetingRahmat - Thank youBread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it‚Äôs a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It‚Äôs one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that‚Äôs eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it‚Äôs pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)Plov is love, remember that when you‚Äôre in Uzbekistan.National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way.

DN5rJ_lKZJw,    Street Food in Bangladesh -The ULTIMATE Old Dhaka Street Food Tour - Bengali Street Food HEAVEN!  ,"Street Food in Bangladesh is AMAZING! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!Make sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger‚ñ∫Make sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ubBangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT!

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!Make sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger‚ñ∫Make sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ubBangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!‚ñ∫ BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioi...The Food Ranger YouTube: ‚ñ∫ www.youtube.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger Instagram:‚ñ∫ www.instagram.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger FB:‚ñ∫ www.facebook.com/thefoodranger‚ñ∫ MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L‚ñ∫BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina‚ñ∫ MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/We're going for more street food around the world!",food vlogs

During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",food vlogs

See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",food vlogs

IiCfEzRvUIQ,"    Philippines Street Food - The ULTIMATE Filipino Food Tour of Quezon City, Metro Manila!  ","Check out this amazing Filipino street food in Quezon City, Philippines!‚ñ∫Subscribe to my YouTube channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe‚ñ∫Follow my Instagram for current updates: https://www.instagram.com/migrationol...First of all, I want to say a big thank you to my friend Reby for accompanying Ying and I on this Filipino street food tour of Quezon City. She loves to eat, and she‚Äôs just an awesome person!Quezon City is a city next to Manila, and it‚Äôs actually a bigger city than Manila, but it‚Äôs part of Manila. So for this Filipino street food tour, I met up with my great friend Reby, who is from Quezon City, and we hit the streets to find some incredibly delicious food. Here‚Äôs everywhere we went and the dishes that we ate.University of the Philippines Diliman - The University of the Philippines is known throughout Manila for its street food stalls, mainly because lots of students gather on campus to enjoy delicious food and hang out.Rodic‚Äôs Diner - Tapsilog - 95 PHP ($1.91) - We began at Rodic‚Äôs Diner a legendary diner at University of Philippines and tried their legendary tapsilog. This is a well known Filipino food dish that includes cured carabao (water buffalo) meat, topped over rice, with a fried egg on top as well. It makes a great breakfast dish, and it was a great way to start the day off with. Outside of the student center, you‚Äôll find some other Filipino street food carts selling snacks like cheese ice cream (20 PHP ($0.40) and cheese corn (20 PHP ($0.40).Mang Larry's Isawan (Isaw - 60 PHP ($1.21) total) - Probaby the most famous street food at University of Philippines in Quezon City is Mang Larry's Isawan, a stall that serves grilled skewers of mostly pig and chicken intestines. The intestines and nice and clean, and grilled over hot fire, before you get them. When you get your skewers, you dip them in vinegar, or more like drown them in vinegar, and eat. They were truly incredible, like little bites of hollow crunchy sausage.Lagro Market - Continuing our Filipino street food tour of Quezon City, Reby brought us to a local market called Lagro Market. As soon as we arrived I noticed one of the coolest rotisserie chicken street food carts that I‚Äôve ever seen, and we had to make a stop and try some of their chicken (lechon manok (roast chicken). The chicken was alright, a little dry, but tasty, and the setting and atmosphere, plus the chicken street food cart, was very cool. Half chicken - 85 PHP ($1.71).Buko (30 PHP ($0.60) - Buko is the word for young coconut, and there‚Äôs nothing more refreshing than a young coconut on the streets of Manila.Mango shrimp paste (7 PHP ($0.14) per piece) - Although this is a humble easy Filipino street food snack, it‚Äôs one of my favorites. A sour green mango is cut, then topped with spicy shrimp paste and you eat it like a caramel apple. Marawi, Mindanao, Philippines Food - We ended this Filipino food tour by going to a random street food stall that we came across, located across the street from the market. The little stall was serving a type of cuisine from Marawi, located on the Southern Philippines island of Mindanao. It was also Halal food, and they had a variety of typical Filipino food dishes like adobo, but also some Filipino dishes I had never tried before due to the regional differences. Although it looks simple and humble, Reby, Ying and I, all thought the food was fantastic. These are the type of street food stalls that I love to eat at most! Total price - 230 PHP ($4.62)Thank you again to Reby for showing us around and for the delicious Filipino food tour of Quezon City!--Camera gear I use:Main camera: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hvMain lens: http://amzn.to/2e5Lum62nd camera: http://amzn.to/2mczuDx2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2dEr9Z9Gorillapod: http://amzn.to/2epFsQx*These are Amazon affiliate linksI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/--Subscribe to my channel for more delicious food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe",food vlogs

-_PMjN31XQk,    OSAKA Street Food Tour - Dotonbori Eating Street!  ,"I finally made it to Japan!! Going to Japan has been a bucket list of mine for a long time, and my main goal there is to eat! Lucky for me, I was able to meet my friend and Japanese cookbook author Hana Etsuko Dethlefsen who was our tour guide. Visit her at hanaetsuko.comOsaka is known as the food city of Japan, so much so that they have a saying here ""kuidaore"" which means to fall over from eating! AND there is even a mascot, kuidaore kun, to go with it! Sounds like our kind of place :)In this episode we walked around Dotonbori, also known as the eating street (I know...how much better could this get!). We walked and ate and walked and ate until the day was over. I managed to try all the dishes Osaka is famous for such as takoyaki and okonomiyaki.Travel Tip: Our strategy for dotonbori is to walk around and eat a little bit at each store so you can eat as many things as possible. If you're with a group of people, order something to share so you don't fill up on one thing. If you go into a sit-down place, many will require that you order one thing per person, but it could be a drink. So we got around that by ordering a refreshing beer wherever we went, which paired very well with the sweet-savoury flavours of Osaka foods.My apologies but I only know the names of 2 places we went to!- Takoyaki Dotonbori Kukuru, Hakua Building 1F, 1 Chome-10-5 Dotonbori Chuo-ku, Osaka- Grill Nanpu (where I had omuraisu) 2 Chome-7-4 Nishishinsaibashi, Chuo, OsakaOSAKA VLOG 2 - Traditional Kaiseki Meal https://youtu.be/fo9tcH2sZswMORE FOOD TRAVEL VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...INGREDIENTS, KITCHEN TOOLS & CAMERA GEAR I USE: https://kit.com/hotthaikitchenWRITTEN RECIPE: https://hot-thai-kitchen.comSUPPORT THE SHOW: https://www.patreon.com/pailinskitchenMY COOKBOOK: https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/htk-cook...CONNECT WITH ME!https://facebook.com/HotThaiKitchenhttps://instagram.com/HotThaiKitchenhttps://twitter.com/HotThaiKitchenhttps://www.pinterest.com/hotthaikitchen----------------About Pai:Pailin ‚ÄúPai‚Äù Chongchitnant is the author of the Hot Thai Kitchen cookbook, co-host of a Canadian TV series One World Kitchen on Gusto TV, and creator and host of the YouTube channel Pailin's Kitchen.

xYeQtO3cFgg,    Going DEEP For Street Food in Morocco - BREAKFAST Tour of Marrakech!  ,"Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! Today, we're GOING DEEP for a FULL-on Street Food BREAKFAST Adventure of Marrakech, Morocco! Moroccan Street Food is some of the BEST in the WORLD, and today, we're going bright and early for a TASTY breakfast tour of Downtown Marrakech, trying a ton of delicious Moroccan street food for breakfast!In Marrakech, there is a ton of amazing street food on every street corner. We travelled to Morocco solely to eat, and chose Marrakech because we heard the food is amazing and that the people are friendly. When we arrived, we started to explore the souq alleyways near Jama El Fna square in downtown Marrakech. What you can find in the souqs will blow you away. There is so many different Moroccan street foods to try. We quickly discovered that Morocco has some of the best street food in the world. So tasty!First up, we found a friendly Bissara soup vendor who let us film this street food vlog and was happy to serve us. The Bissara soup is a fava bean aka broadbean soup served with bread for breakfast. It was scooped out of a big pot and served by bowl to all the hungry locals. This man was definitely a character, and super friendly too. He gave all the local Moroccans a free bowl if they couldn't afford it. Next, we went for another local street food in Morocco, the Hassowa. It was a super strong, almost spicy soup made from oregano and semolina. The man who served this street food in Marrakech had served this for 16 years in the streets of the old Medina in Marrakech. After this, we went for more Moroccan breakfast and ordered a Msemen moroccan flatbread. It was served with a ton of butter and honey and was super oily yet crispy at the same time. The lady who cooked it was also very friendly and was making a ton of the msemen for the hungry locals!For our next breakfast meal, we enjoyed a truly classic Moroccan breakfast street food, the Khlea. The Khlea is a moroccan omelette made with 2 or 3 eggs and a few slices of Khlea preserved beef with smen moroccan preserved butter. It was super heavy and a little salty from the butter and beef.And for our final meal, while not quite breakfast, was a Moroccan tajine made with beef and carrots and potato and zuchinni, found right on the street!The addresses for the street food locations found in this street food vlog are below:1) Bissara soup vendor: Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a ton of guys around the wall in the morning selling it.2) Hassowa soup vendor: Near the Jama El Fna square of old Marrakech. This one was just a lucky find, you gotta go deep into the alleyways to find stuff like this.3) Msemen Moroccan flatbread. You can find this one again in the back alleyways. Right behind the olive guys at the back of the Jama El Fna square in the morning for breakfast.4) Khlea egg omelette with preserved beef and smen butter. We found this one at a local cafe called Zeitoun Cafe AKA the olive cafe in the Medina of Marrakech.. I must admit it was a little tourist and maybe less DEEP than other places, but the omelette was nice and tasty.5) Delicious Moroccan Tajine DEEP in the streets. This one was also near the Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a street full of restaurants selling everything from these tajines to grilled BBQ fish and more. It was amazing!The Food Ranger YouTube: ‚ñ∫ www.youtube.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger Instagram:‚ñ∫ www.instagram.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger FB:‚ñ∫ www.facebook.com/thefoodrangerMY GEAR AND RESOURCES:‚ñ∫ New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg‚ñ∫ Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr‚ñ∫ Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG‚ñ∫ Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU‚ñ∫ Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb‚ñ∫ Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec‚ñ∫ Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc‚ñ∫ Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO‚ñ∫ Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD‚ñ∫ Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3‚ñ∫ Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS‚ñ∫ How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3‚ñ∫ MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L‚ñ∫BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina‚ñ∫ MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/Thanks so much for watching all of my Moroccan street food tour videos! ‚ñ∫ My Food Blog: https://www.thefoodranger.com/",food vlogs

The lady who cooked it was also very friendly and was making a ton of the msemen for the hungry locals!For our next breakfast meal, we enjoyed a truly classic Moroccan breakfast street food, the Khlea. The Khlea is a moroccan omelette made with 2 or 3 eggs and a few slices of Khlea preserved beef with smen moroccan preserved butter. It was super heavy and a little salty from the butter and beef.And for our final meal, while not quite breakfast, was a Moroccan tajine made with beef and carrots and potato and zuchinni, found right on the street!The addresses for the street food locations found in this street food vlog are below:1) Bissara soup vendor: Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a ton of guys around the wall in the morning selling it.2) Hassowa soup vendor: Near the Jama El Fna square of old Marrakech. This one was just a lucky find, you gotta go deep into the alleyways to find stuff like this.3) Msemen Moroccan flatbread. You can find this one again in the back alleyways. Right behind the olive guys at the back of the Jama El Fna square in the morning for breakfast.4) Khlea egg omelette with preserved beef and smen butter. We found this one at a local cafe called Zeitoun Cafe AKA the olive cafe in the Medina of Marrakech.. I must admit it was a little tourist and maybe less DEEP than other places, but the omelette was nice and tasty.5) Delicious Moroccan Tajine DEEP in the streets. This one was also near the Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a street full of restaurants selling everything from these tajines to grilled BBQ fish and more. It was amazing!The Food Ranger YouTube: ‚ñ∫ www.youtube.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger Instagram:‚ñ∫ www.instagram.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger FB:‚ñ∫ www.facebook.com/thefoodrangerMY GEAR AND RESOURCES:‚ñ∫ New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg‚ñ∫ Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr‚ñ∫ Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG‚ñ∫ Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU‚ñ∫ Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb‚ñ∫ Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec‚ñ∫ Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc‚ñ∫ Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO‚ñ∫ Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD‚ñ∫ Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3‚ñ∫ Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS‚ñ∫ How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3‚ñ∫ MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L‚ñ∫BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina‚ñ∫ MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/Thanks so much for watching all of my Moroccan street food tour videos! ‚ñ∫ My Food Blog: https://www.thefoodranger.com/",food vlogs

FLmNLrog6dQ,    The Ultimate JERUSALEM FOOD TOUR + Attractions - Palestinian Food and Israeli Food in Old Jerusalem!  ,"Join us on the ultimate Jerusalem food tour!Follow David on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....Also, thanks to Rafram: http://rafram.com/Subscribe for more videos‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeT-shirts for sale here‚ñ∫ https://migrationology.com/store/There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem! We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:Hummus AcramawiPrice - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plateAlmond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)Al-shuala Grill RestaurantShawarma - 26 ILS ($7.26)Al Baghdadi KababPalestinian kebabsTotal price - 100 ILS ($27.89)Zalatimo SweetsMutabakPrice - 30 ILS ($8.37) eachPeaches - 10 for 1 kgPlums - 10 for 1 kgFruit - 10 ILS ($2.76) per kg.Mahane Yehuda MarketAzura RestaurantTotal price - 400 ILS ($111.55)Western Wall (Wailing Wall)Western Wall TunnelPrice - 35 ILS ($9.76) per personDome of the RockMount of OlivesMachneyuda RestaurantTotal price - 700 ILS ($195.21)It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.Thank you again to David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!-MUSIC in This Video:  Souls of Time, Arabian Feast - https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):GH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you for watching!",food vlogs

eDvP80AVwRA,    FOREIGNERS TRY CRAZY GOOD FILIPINO FOOD & FILIPINO STREET FOOD  ,"Our next Filipino Food taste test took us to Mama's Grill in Siargao Island to taste insane grilled filipino food. We tried grilled pork, grilled chicken, grilled squid and an amazing chorizo or longanisa.This week we made some more awesome Filipino Food - more specifically we made lechon kawali and let our friends here in Miami try it. It took a lot of research finding out how to make lechon kawali but it was wort doing my research on this lechon belly dish.This filipino food taste test was a lot of fun and my americans trying filipino food really enjoyed the taste and concept.

Xdya8eym9nM,"    Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore, Pakistan!  ","Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjHSUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lAlso, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4I‚Äôm very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I‚Äôve ever had, called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It‚Äôs a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you‚Äôll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi‚Äôs in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You‚Äôll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali‚Äôs favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQQ How do you work together with brands?A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",travel vlogs

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQQ How do you work together with brands?A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",travel vlogs

When my dad told me he was coming to India I knew I had to give him a special Rajasthan surprise. Being in touch with The Fairmont Jaipur Hotel we arranged to be here for two nights.

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",travel vlogs

During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side.

I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",travel vlogs

LXgQjtWcUlA,    Travel Vlog: Jamaica 2019!  ,"So excited to share my Jamaica Travel Vlog! Last week I took a vacation to Ocho Rios, in collaboration with Jamaica Inn resort, and can officially say I am in love with Jamaica!  This was my first trip to Jamaica, but definitely not my last! During my trip I got any opportunity to visit Dunn's River Falls and the Blue Hole.  Staying at the Jamaica Inn was a dream, it was so relaxing, beautiful, and inspiring.  The rooms are very tastefully decorated with a big nod to traditional, but still managed to feel modern and fresh.  Their staff was top notch who were more like family than people at work.  When booking your travel to Ocho Rios, the Jamaican Inn will be the only stop you will need to make, because it really has it all.  As you could see in my vlog, I could do as much or as little as I wanted in terms of excursions.  I often chose to relax because when I'm home I get to do very little of that! ha!I hope you enjoyed Traveling with Me!Do you have travel plans for 2019?

Last week I took a vacation to Ocho Rios, in collaboration with Jamaica Inn resort, and can officially say I am in love with Jamaica!  This was my first trip to Jamaica, but definitely not my last! During my trip I got any opportunity to visit Dunn's River Falls and the Blue Hole.  Staying at the Jamaica Inn was a dream, it was so relaxing, beautiful, and inspiring.  The rooms are very tastefully decorated with a big nod to traditional, but still managed to feel modern and fresh.  Their staff was top notch who were more like family than people at work.  When booking your travel to Ocho Rios, the Jamaican Inn will be the only stop you will need to make, because it really has it all.  As you could see in my vlog, I could do as much or as little as I wanted in terms of excursions.  I often chose to relax because when I'm home I get to do very little of that! ha!I hope you enjoyed Traveling with Me!Do you have travel plans for 2019?

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQQ How do you work together with brands?A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",travel vlogs

I started posting outfit of the day (OOTD) photos on Instagram about two years ago when I was living in Dallas, Texas for work. I loved taking photos and posting on Instagram so much that I decided to expand and try out YouTube and blogging as well.When I was living in the city, my personal style was a bit more streetwear 90's grunge, but now that I live in Southern California and closer to the ocean, my style has become a lot more cozy and comfortable with a lot of bohemian influences.If I had to describe my fashion sense on my blog, Instagram aesthetic, and YouTube editing style now, I'd probably describe it as modern bohemian with an edge, since I tend to wear and do things that might be considered unconventional to others. I'm not sure if that is true, but since I've moved back to California, I just find that I gravitate to what is easiest and effortless for me while living near the beach where it always feels like summer.Thank you so much for stopping by my YouTube channel and I hope that you enjoy what you'll find here! I love fashion, beauty (especially hair styling and bohemian braids), DIY projects and how to videos, making travel diaries of all the places that I'm lucky enough to visit, and sharing my (for lack of a better term) ""modern bohemian"" lifestyle.

During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side.

I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",travel vlogs

Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQQ How do you work together with brands?A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",travel vlogs

l2t6ful9mmw,    LUXOR TEMPLE & VALLEY OF THE KINGS | Egypt Travel Vlog  ,"We only had one day to explore Luxor, Egypt, so even though we barely slept on the overnight train from Cairo, we went out at 7:00 A.M. to be the first and only tourists at the incredible Luxor Temple! It was totally worth it because it wasn't too hot yet and we took all the videos and photos we wanted with NO other people! Once the first tour bus arrived, we headed back to our hotel and had breakfast (AND COFFEE), but then decided to nap for few hours to wait out the mid day heat before heading to the Valley of the Kings via a $0.10 ferry and $7 taxi. Once again, we felt like there should have been way more tourists than there was, but we weren't complaining!Top 10 Travel Credit Cards August Edition: https://karaandnate.com/the-top-10-pe...

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",travel vlogs

Ivn4-GzrETM,    WHANG OD Tattoo... GONE WILD? üòÆKalinga Tattoo Philippines travel vlog 2018  ,"https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfarIn this Philippines travel vlog, I head to Kalinga in northern Luzon to find the tattoo artist legend Apo Whang Od. The last mambatok, a style of traditional tattoo found only in the Philippines.The people of Kalinga were head hunters. Buscalan, the home of Wang Od was particularly famous for their strange tradition of tattooing. They thought tattoos were beautiful, and the women would cover themselves in full body tattoos to attract men. The men however, would have to earn their tattoos by bringing back the heads of rival tribes. The more ink, the greater the warrior.After being featured recently in a documentary, and multiple TV shows, visiting Whang-Od and her granddaughters has become a tourist attraction. Many people make the trip from Manila to receive one.It's about a 12h bus ride north of Manila to Sagada, from there, it's another 4 hours to the trail to Buscalan, then an hour walk.To my filipino and filipina fans. Would do you get a tattoo from Apo Whang Od?

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",travel vlogs

But Ken and Gratiana from http://cowokrakus.com/ invited my wife Ying and I to go with them and their family on an Indonesian food trip to Bogor and the surrounding region (about an hour from Jakarta).Our first stop when we drove out of Jakarta and to Bogor was a famous place to eat Bogor style laksa at a restaurant called Laksa Bogor Pak Inin. It was exactly my kind of a restaurant, open air and local, with a wonderful friendly environment. The laksa was unlike any other laksa I‚Äôve ever had, and it was fantastic. Laksa Bogor - 10,000 IDR ($0.72)Next, we stopped at a place called Toge Goreng Pak Abung, which is another legendary Indonesian food stop in Bogor, Indonesia, and they are famous for serving a bean sprout snack. It was definitely a very interesting dish, including a mixture of bean sprouts and fermented soy beans. Toge Goreng - 7,000 IDR ($0.51)Next we drove into the beautiful Indonesian countryside and to the house. After having some Indonesian snacks and refreshing coconut, we then took a hike to go look for honey. The beekeeper was sick on the day we went, so we we‚Äôre able to get any honey, but it was still a beautiful hike.The highlight of this Indonesian food trip for me was the Sundanese style Nasi Liwet Botram family feast that we had. All the food was laid out on banana leaves, and we all sat and ate some of the most beautiful and flavorful Indonesian food. It was an incredible culinary experience.We drove back to Bogor and stopped at Warung Nasi Ampera to eat a quick dinner, and because I wanted to try some ikan pepes. The food was alright, but nothing compared to the lunch feast we had eaten! Total price - 103,000 IDR ($7.46) for 3 plates of foodFinally, back in Jakarta, we stopped near Manga Besar to have some desserts and to finish of this incredible day of Indonesian food. Sekoteng - 12,000 IDR ($0.87), Wedang Ronde - 12,000 IDR ($0.87)It was an incredible Indonesian food trip to the outskirts of Bogor, and a nice opportunity to get out of Jakarta for the day.A big thank you to Ken, Gratiana, and her family for inviting us to their house country house and for the amazing food.--KEN:Videos : https://www.youtube.com/c/cowokrakustubeBlog: http://cowokrakus.com/MY WEBSITES:Migrationology.com: http://migrationology.com/EatingThaiFood.com: http://eatingthaifood.com/TravelByYing.com: http://travelbyying.com/Camera I use: https://migrationology.com/travel-res...T-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/Get e-mail updates: https://migrationology.com/free-updatesSOCIAL MEDIA:Snapchat: @migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology‚ñ∫Jakarta Travel Guide: https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...‚ñ∫50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...--Thank you for watching this Indonesian food video!",food vlogs

","Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!Peyman‚Äôs Channel‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...Subscribe for 2 new videos per week‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeWhen I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.Price - 6 AED ($1.63) eachMachboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!MUSIC:***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8hMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zGorillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Check out Peyman‚Äôs channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...",food vlogs

This truly is some of the most UNIQUE street food in China, starting out right away with BREAKFAST! The local street food recipes were incredible!MY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH‚ñ∫ New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg‚ñ∫ Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr‚ñ∫ Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG‚ñ∫ Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU‚ñ∫ Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb‚ñ∫ Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec‚ñ∫ Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc‚ñ∫ Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO‚ñ∫ Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD‚ñ∫ Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3‚ñ∫ Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS‚ñ∫ How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3‚ñ∫ MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L‚ñ∫BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina‚ñ∫ MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/We tasted a few amazing dishes, bright and early!First up, for breakfast, we found a lady selling this incredible milk cheese, kind of like curdled milk, right on the street. You can eat it plain or you can order it fried for breakfast with a lot of sugar. We ended up trying both. Then, we walked down the street and had a nice and hearty and healthy lunch soup, and rice as well. Super tasty and delicious!Then we went for a walk and found some street ""huajuan"" rolls stuffed with fermented tofu, very strong and pungent!All of this was found during the weekly farmers market on the street in Shaxi every friday! If you come to Yunnan in Southern China, come to Shaxi on a friday to visit one of the most amazing street markets! You have to come check it out!After that, we went for a lunch and tasted classic bai cuisine, including local Matsutake mushrooms and amazing salted pork, which kind of tasted like pastrami!

Since we love street food around the world, we decided that Vietnam was the perfect holiday destination for street food to try, because it's supposed to be the best and we love watching new street food recipes and street food flavors as we adventure down deep, back alleyways, getting lost into new street food worlds.  So far, in our Vietnamese street food tour series, we've eaten street food in Hanoi, and then we took the sleeper train south 12 hours to Hue. Hue is the old ancient capital of Vietnam, and is packed full of different street food to try. We spent 4 days here eating and couldn't get enough of all the street food. Asian street food is the best, and in Vietnam, it doesn't get any better!We found 11 different Vietnamese street foods in this video. If you arrive here looking to eat, you can follow along with these addresses:1) Bun Bo hue @02:44- The specialty street food Beef and pork broth noodle soup of Hue, Vietnam - It‚Äôs absolutely rich and delicious! Found at the Dong Ba market early morning around 730am. Go to the outside of the street market and find the old ladies with big pots of good street food and you‚Äôll discover a ton!2) Bun Hen @ 06:10 Spicy Clam noodle soup - Also found at the Dong Ba Market in Hue, Vietnam, in the early morning! Just look around the outside of the market, the perimeter, not on the inside.3) Banh Tam Banana Leaf @ 09:44 wrapped around marinated shrimp - Found directly beside the Bun Hen at Dong Ba market4) Veg Soup @ 11:27 - Also found at Dong Ba Street Food Market in Hue, Vietnam5) Bun Tith Nuong @ 14:37 Grilled pork over top of rice noodles.

This one was at the intersection of Xuan 68 and Le Thanh Ton street inside Hue‚Äôs old city.7) Douhua Silken Tofu @ 21:27 - This was a street food vendor carrying the food on wooden poles, so you have to be lucky at the right place at the right time. We were at the location below around 4:30 PM and she came along.8) Banh Tran Truong ‚ÄúVietnamese Pizza made from rice paper‚Äù @ 22:54.

Z8deyiVL1-8,    Vile Parle East Street Food with SugarSpiceNice India  ,"Hello Hungryheads!Go subscribe to SugarSpiceNice India here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOsY...Go look for me on Shweta's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgEg-...--------------------------------------------------------In this food vlog, I took Shweta around Vile Parle East and enjoyed a ton of street food items that I have been eating since childhood. Filming this was like a trip down the memory lane for me. The first stop we made was at Sanmitra Dosa Centre. We opted for the Schezwan Cheese Onion Sada Dosa. Address: 55, Prabhat Cottage, Hanuman Road, Near Parle Tilak Vidyalaya, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057.We washed it down with a refreshing glass of sugarcane juice from a vendor right next to the dosa place. Next we went for a pizza toast sandwich, which used to be one of my favourites growing up accompanied by a black currant milkshake, which they call purple cow! You will get very many sandwich and juice options at Shree Annapurna. Address: Building plot no 23b, Shop No 1, Time Field Corporation, 2, Subhash Rd, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057After all that, we were pretty tired walking around, so we make a halt at Wagh Bakri Tea Lounge and called for their strong adrak-wali chai.Address: Ground Floor, Waman Co-Operative Housing Society, Hanuman Road, Opp. Paleshwar Mandir, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057There was no way we could miss chaat on a street food tour! So I took Shweta to my all time favourite Sharma Bhelpuri House. We both shared the lip smacking Sev Puri, Dahi Puri and Paani Puri.Address: Kamla Bhawan, Mahatma Gandhi Rd, Opp. Municipal Garnden, Vile Parle East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400057Before Shweta left for home, we decided to taste Aarey Lassi, which I drank after ages! It was not like it used be in its taste, packaging or price. --------------------------------------------------------------You can check out my other Mumbai food Vlogs too!Seafood Restaurants: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLYxc...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hJzd...-------------------------------------------------------------------You can buy my gear using my Amazon links:My Camera - https://amzn.to/2EnoNLTMy Mic - https://amzn.to/2CIPPvJVlogging Lens - https://amzn.to/2J112YQFollow me on Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/curlsbooksn...Write to me at : curlsbooksnbites@gmail.com",food vlogs

Have been living in Amsterdam for over 5 years.Q How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job.

I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences.

EKDx1Xd8-ZY,    19 Travel YouTuber's You Must Follow in 2019 - The BEST Travel Vloggers  ,"Hey guys! I‚Äôve been a travel and food YouTuber for almost a decade now and over the years I‚Äôve come across a lot of fellow travelers and foodies who create mind blowing content that inspires me on a daily basis. A few of them have even become friends of mine. So today I want to do something a little different from what I usually do.

Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty.

Manila especially is great for this!Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party.

A3xHJzNNM2A,"    Street Food in Uzbekistan - 1,500 KG. of RICE PLOV (Pilau) + Market Tour in Tashkent!  ","‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you to B. Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZWRavshan‚Äôs Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...Uzbekistan Day 1: TashkentOn Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / GreetingRahmat - Thank youBread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it‚Äôs a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It‚Äôs one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that‚Äôs eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it‚Äôs pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)Plov is love, remember that when you‚Äôre in Uzbekistan.National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way. Thank you for watching this Uzbekistan food tour!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",food vlogs

Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZWRavshan‚Äôs Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...Uzbekistan Day 1: TashkentOn Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / GreetingRahmat - Thank youBread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it‚Äôs a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It‚Äôs one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that‚Äôs eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it‚Äôs pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)Plov is love, remember that when you‚Äôre in Uzbekistan.National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way. Thank you for watching this Uzbekistan food tour!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",food vlogs

We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT!

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ",food vlogs

We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",food vlogs

4u3f7_p1i8c,    Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field  ,"John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India, 20 February, 2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern WorldVedic Science is scientific, practical, and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life‚Äîthe field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature‚Äôs functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well‚Äîthe self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.The process of transcending‚Äîmoving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)‚Äîprovides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)‚Äîthe union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a ‚Äúwakeful hypo-metabolic state‚Äù of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects.

The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life‚Äîthe field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature‚Äôs functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well‚Äîthe self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.The process of transcending‚Äîmoving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)‚Äîprovides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)‚Äîthe union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a ‚Äúwakeful hypo-metabolic state‚Äù of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects.

xLXOrXd5Bl4,    History of Food Science & Technology [For Beginners]  ,"Do you know that most of the food we see on the shelf of the supermarkets today, wasn‚Äôt available a 100-150 years from now? This was because there were very few techniques to preserve the food. The food would spoil very fast and a lot of people suffered from food poisoning and even death. The food we eat today, is completely taken for granted because it is cheap and easily available. The food you and I are eating today has been possible because of the efforts of a lot of scientists, researchers, engineers, food technologists, nutritionists so that the food you are eating is safe and healthy. But the process of developing food wasn‚Äôt invented overnight. So, what is the history and how food technology originated?Well if you ask me, I think the preservation of food has been abundant since early human started farming. Early humans realized the fact that they could not always hunt for animals or pluck fruits from trees every day. And if they stored the food like meat, it spoiled very fast. So, they had to develop some preservation techniques for eating the food even when they could not hunt, or the fruits and vegetables weren‚Äôt available.Some of the earliest preservation techniques include Sun-Drying, freezing, salting, fermentation and so on. The downside of the early preservation techniques was that they changed the flavour and texture of the food along with huge loss of vitamins most of the time. These techniques were not very effective for travellers and soldiers who needed a healthy diet. During the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815), the French Government offered 12,000 Francs to anyone who could develop a method for preserving food for the military. In 1809, a French confectioner and chef developed a method of sealing the food in glass jars. The name of that French man was ‚ÄòNicholas Appert‚Äô. The process was simple. He sealed the food in a glass jar and then heated the jar for some time depending upon the food. The method proved to be successful and he was awarded 12,000 Francs. The invention of canning is considered as the major turning point in the history of food technology and food science. Because of his remarkable contribution, Nicholas Appert is also known as the ‚ÄòFather of Canning‚Äô. And even canning is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄòAppertization‚Äô. Although canning was successful but the science behind its success wasn‚Äôt known until 50 years later, when a French microbiologist and chemist showed that growth of micro-organisms is responsible for the spoilage of beverages. He also invented a process where milk was heated to a specific temperature for a specified time to kill the spoilage micro-organisms. That French microbiologist was none other than Louis Pasteur. The process he invented is still prevalent in the dairy industry and wine industry as well. And in the honour of Louis Pasteur, the process is known as ‚ÄòPasteurization‚Äô. In 1895, almost a 30 years later in Boston, Massachusetts, William Lyman Underwood of a canning company worked with Samuel Prescott to develop the research which would further lead to the concept of ‚ÄòThermal Death Time‚Äô. A lot of people don‚Äôt consider this event when it comes to the history of food technology, but this was also one of the turning points in the history as their research was important to determine the time-temperature combination for a food. That means, for how long a food will be cooked at what temperature. Since then, a lot of research and discoveries had been done but in the 20th century, food safety was still an issue. In 1960, the Pillsbury company, NASA and the USA army labs collaborated to develop safe and healthy food for the astronauts. Eventually, they developed a systematic preventive approach to ensure food safety and that came to be known as ‚ÄòHACCP‚Äô. HACCP is a preventive tool used in food industry to ensure safety of the food.HACCP is prevalent today in every food industry and food safety is incomplete without the implementation of the HACCP program. Since the development of HACCP, there have been a lot of rapid growth in the food technology. Industrialists have adopted newer technologies to process the food in a faster and efficient way. So, these were some of the major breakthroughs in the history of food technology.-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""What Is Food Safety & Why You Need to Know About It?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQLvn...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",science and technology

That means, for how long a food will be cooked at what temperature. Since then, a lot of research and discoveries had been done but in the 20th century, food safety was still an issue. In 1960, the Pillsbury company, NASA and the USA army labs collaborated to develop safe and healthy food for the astronauts. Eventually, they developed a systematic preventive approach to ensure food safety and that came to be known as ‚ÄòHACCP‚Äô. HACCP is a preventive tool used in food industry to ensure safety of the food.HACCP is prevalent today in every food industry and food safety is incomplete without the implementation of the HACCP program. Since the development of HACCP, there have been a lot of rapid growth in the food technology. Industrialists have adopted newer technologies to process the food in a faster and efficient way.

ijbsGfijex8,    New developments are taking shape at DLSU Science and Technology Complex!  ,"Do you know that most of the food we see on the shelf of the supermarkets today, wasn‚Äôt available a 100-150 years from now? This was because there were very few techniques to preserve the food. The food would spoil very fast and a lot of people suffered from food poisoning and even death. The food we eat today, is completely taken for granted because it is cheap and easily available. The food you and I are eating today has been possible because of the efforts of a lot of scientists, researchers, engineers, food technologists, nutritionists so that the food you are eating is safe and healthy. But the process of developing food wasn‚Äôt invented overnight. So, what is the history and how food technology originated?Well if you ask me, I think the preservation of food has been abundant since early human started farming. Early humans realized the fact that they could not always hunt for animals or pluck fruits from trees every day. And if they stored the food like meat, it spoiled very fast. So, they had to develop some preservation techniques for eating the food even when they could not hunt, or the fruits and vegetables weren‚Äôt available.Some of the earliest preservation techniques include Sun-Drying, freezing, salting, fermentation and so on. The downside of the early preservation techniques was that they changed the flavour and texture of the food along with huge loss of vitamins most of the time. These techniques were not very effective for travellers and soldiers who needed a healthy diet. During the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815), the French Government offered 12,000 Francs to anyone who could develop a method for preserving food for the military. In 1809, a French confectioner and chef developed a method of sealing the food in glass jars. The name of that French man was ‚ÄòNicholas Appert‚Äô. The process was simple. He sealed the food in a glass jar and then heated the jar for some time depending upon the food. The method proved to be successful and he was awarded 12,000 Francs. The invention of canning is considered as the major turning point in the history of food technology and food science. Because of his remarkable contribution, Nicholas Appert is also known as the ‚ÄòFather of Canning‚Äô. And even canning is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄòAppertization‚Äô. Although canning was successful but the science behind its success wasn‚Äôt known until 50 years later, when a French microbiologist and chemist showed that growth of micro-organisms is responsible for the spoilage of beverages. He also invented a process where milk was heated to a specific temperature for a specified time to kill the spoilage micro-organisms. That French microbiologist was none other than Louis Pasteur. The process he invented is still prevalent in the dairy industry and wine industry as well. And in the honour of Louis Pasteur, the process is known as ‚ÄòPasteurization‚Äô.

Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

yX_y2SAAhPg,    Shiroyama ‚Äì The Satsuma Rebellion ‚Äì Sabaton History 007  ,"What will you do when your traditional way of life is threatened by a powerful force in your native lands? The samurai didn't hesitate to answer this question with: our swords. During the Satsuma Rebellion,  the samurai and its leader Saig≈ç Takamori fought the Japanese Imperial Government. Their rebellion ended with the Battle of Shiroyama, where in 1877 the samurai prepared for a last stand. The letter demanding Saigo's surrender: As the leader of young vigorous men of the nation and resisting a great and famous army through many fierce battles, your fame is already well enough know to the world. But now most of your brave generals are dead or injured, and your military power is daily growing weaker. It is already clear that as last your Satsuma army is unable to keep its spirit. I don‚Äôt know what further things you can hope to achieve, except a hopeless defensive battle. If you, Saig√µ, rather than lengthening the rest of your days a little, prefer to cause hundreds and thousands of dead and wounded from both armies, there is nothing that I, Aritomo, can say to you. I beg you to judge for yourself as you hold matters in the palm of your hand, and that you will save both armies from death and injury. Ah, you are a man famous and known in the world.

yX_y2SAAhPg,    Shiroyama ‚Äì The Satsuma Rebellion ‚Äì Sabaton History 007  ,"What will you do when your traditional way of life is threatened by a powerful force in your native lands? The samurai didn't hesitate to answer this question with: our swords. During the Satsuma Rebellion,  the samurai and its leader Saig≈ç Takamori fought the Japanese Imperial Government. Their rebellion ended with the Battle of Shiroyama, where in 1877 the samurai prepared for a last stand. The letter demanding Saigo's surrender: As the leader of young vigorous men of the nation and resisting a great and famous army through many fierce battles, your fame is already well enough know to the world. But now most of your brave generals are dead or injured, and your military power is daily growing weaker. It is already clear that as last your Satsuma army is unable to keep its spirit. I don‚Äôt know what further things you can hope to achieve, except a hopeless defensive battle. If you, Saig√µ, rather than lengthening the rest of your days a little, prefer to cause hundreds and thousands of dead and wounded from both armies, there is nothing that I, Aritomo, can say to you. I beg you to judge for yourself as you hold matters in the palm of your hand, and that you will save both armies from death and injury. Ah, you are a man famous and known in the world. About our national constitution naturally it is not only Aritomo who knows what you really think. But the matter has been settled over many years of public debate. I, Aritomo, earnestly beg you as your old friend. Writing this my tears fall like rain, and I cannot express myself at all. Please sympathise with the sincerity of my pain.

00-Sce-bg3s,    Times The History Channel Lied To You  ,"Old timers might remember the History Channel as a stream of World War II documentaries, but a lot has changed since then. The new History is a cranky old conspiracy theorist who secretly binges reality shows. Here are some of the times the History Channel lied to you. In 1945, Adolf Hitler took his own life in his underground bunker. That's reality. Conspiracy theories about how he might've escaped aren't just wrong, but deeply offensive. Unfortunately, back in 2014, people got riled up when the FBI declassified documents reporting on the possibility that Hitler had actually run away to South America, shaved his mustache, and assumed a new identity. Here's the thing: FBI reports don't mean something really happened, because the FBI has to document everything, no matter how stupid it is. So every time a lunatic or attention seeker claimed to see Hitler, the FBI wrote it down - that's their job. As Skeptoid points out, they have been forced to document all kinds of nonsensical falsehoods.  Then in 2015, according to Variety, the History Channel basically gave real history the middle finger. The reality show Hunting Hitler, apparently an effort to finally settle the matter with a crack team of investigators, was really nothing more than a ratings ploy. The series showed the team go to Argentina and investigate false leads which proved nothing whatsoever‚Ä¶ because, well, no genuine evidence exists. Aside from trivializing the subject matter, Hunting Hitler also trivialized reality.Watch the video for more times The History Channel lied to you!#HistoryChannel #History #AncientAliensHunting Hitler | 0:16The Kennedys | 1:24The Bible | 2:362012 doomsday exaggeration | 3:42Bigfoot Captured | 4:43All of Ancient Aliens | 5:45Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence | 6:43Mountain Men | 7:43Don't mess with Texas | 8:31Skipping Christmas | 9:23Pawn Stars | 10:25",history

BjkU_JR4Cno,    England's Forgotten Queen: Lady Jane Grey's Execution | History Documentary | Reel Truth History  ,"Eight days into her reign as Queen of England, Lady Jane Grey took personal charge of the keys to the Tower of London and even locked her own supporters inside with her. The end was approaching but before her execution, she wrote multiple messages in her prayer book. Historian Helen Castor explores these notes and learns that Lady Jane was actually unflinching and composed until the day she died.In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to ReelTruth.History the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

i8-V4yuM984,    Replay: A Metal Tribute to the History of Video Games  ,"MP3: http://bit.ly/1qxfaKBWAV: http://bit.ly/1mtnpXSHelp me make more covers with Patreon!https://www.patreon.com/familyjules7x...Buy my music!http://familyjules7x.bandcamp.com/https://loudr.fm/artist/familyjules7x...Ending a 3 year project is nothing to go lightly on. I knew that if I were to do something big for the end of this year, it would have to literally be beyond me and my potential and this medley was just that. This medley was begun a week and a day before it was released. I made this during the same week as my last year of college finals and during hell weeks for numerous other projects rendering me very little possible time to work on it. Still the time restraint gave me One day for arranging, one day for drum programming, one day for doing all of the mixing and mastering and one day to edit this beast of a video. This was because recording all of the audio took 4 days of straight recording to finish. Things didn't go to plan, namely I wish I had had more time to practice with the green screen and make sure all the shots would work with it and I wish I had more time to mix and master.Why would I do that, you may ask. Why would I give myself a week to produce a 17 minute medley with 38 songs and also incorporate techniques like green screening I've never even practiced for video before? Because if there's anything I've tried to do in these past 4 years of being on YouTube and not just with video game covers, it's push myself to my absolute potential. What you're watching is literally the best I can do given a week to put a video together and I'm not sure I can ever top this in that amount of time. Hence why I will be stopping weekly cover thus far. I'll be touching up on that in the update video coming soon.That out of the way, I had a ridiculously fun time making this. The covers in the style I was doing them started to drain on me and I had to do something different. I've been planning something like this since the very beginning of my YouTube videos as I was greatly inspired by the Mario Paint video Evolution of Video Gaming, not to mention people like Fredde Gredde who put countless songs in one video and still made it enjoyable regardless of the length. I hope this video does everything I hoped it would for you and really take you on a journey through the amazing short life video gaming has had since 1972. These past 4 years have been a journey for me and this was the best way to repay you guys in my eyes.

i8-V4yuM984,    Replay: A Metal Tribute to the History of Video Games  ,"MP3: http://bit.ly/1qxfaKBWAV: http://bit.ly/1mtnpXSHelp me make more covers with Patreon!https://www.patreon.com/familyjules7x...Buy my music!http://familyjules7x.bandcamp.com/https://loudr.fm/artist/familyjules7x...Ending a 3 year project is nothing to go lightly on. I knew that if I were to do something big for the end of this year, it would have to literally be beyond me and my potential and this medley was just that. This medley was begun a week and a day before it was released. I made this during the same week as my last year of college finals and during hell weeks for numerous other projects rendering me very little possible time to work on it. Still the time restraint gave me One day for arranging, one day for drum programming, one day for doing all of the mixing and mastering and one day to edit this beast of a video. This was because recording all of the audio took 4 days of straight recording to finish. Things didn't go to plan, namely I wish I had had more time to practice with the green screen and make sure all the shots would work with it and I wish I had more time to mix and master.Why would I do that, you may ask. Why would I give myself a week to produce a 17 minute medley with 38 songs and also incorporate techniques like green screening I've never even practiced for video before? Because if there's anything I've tried to do in these past 4 years of being on YouTube and not just with video game covers, it's push myself to my absolute potential. What you're watching is literally the best I can do given a week to put a video together and I'm not sure I can ever top this in that amount of time. Hence why I will be stopping weekly cover thus far. I'll be touching up on that in the update video coming soon.That out of the way, I had a ridiculously fun time making this. The covers in the style I was doing them started to drain on me and I had to do something different. I've been planning something like this since the very beginning of my YouTube videos as I was greatly inspired by the Mario Paint video Evolution of Video Gaming, not to mention people like Fredde Gredde who put countless songs in one video and still made it enjoyable regardless of the length. I hope this video does everything I hoped it would for you and really take you on a journey through the amazing short life video gaming has had since 1972. These past 4 years have been a journey for me and this was the best way to repay you guys in my eyes. Because of your support, I have had opportunities to do things I couldn't have ever dreamed of and even when I was worried this video wouldn't get done, or spending countless minutes I didn't have nailing a riff, I knew that this video would be my greatest thank you possible to the worlds most amazing fan base.There are no words that can possibly express my gratitude so I'll leave it just as I left this video.Thank you for playing.

iloQeu-Yg7U,    The Biggest Lies Told in History  ,"From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",history

James explains: http://bit.ly/1Pzy1k5____________Richard ""the Challenger"" Cutland, ex British tankie and military specialist at Wargaming, stops by to talk about the types of tanks involved in the Battle of Kursk! Early in Operation Barbarossa, the Germans didn't expect much from their opponents. They did not know about the T-34 and KV-1 tanks, which turned out to be superior designs. The Germans deployed a special commission to study Soviet tank designs and soon introduced the Tiger, Panther, and Ferdinand tanks which Hitler believed were key to victory. The Panther in particular was now outclassing Soviet tanks, but it had giant mechanical issues and broke down frequently. The Soviets had produced a new T-43 model tank, but it was designed to tackle the old German Panzer IV and didn't measure up well to the new German tanks. So they preferred to focus on the trusty T-34 tanks, which made up in speed and numbers what they lacked in range and firepower. The Kursk region also played to the Soviets' advantage in Russia: the dust storms and mudfields hindered air support from the Luftwaffe and the advance of the Wermacht. Erich von Manstein, the German commander, decided not to advance. Instead he yielded ground to the Soviets in an attempt to lure them into overextending. He successfully caught them out at the First Battle of Kharkov, but even though the Soviets suffered heavy casualties there, it wasn't enough to make a dent in their huge army. Manstein needed to do something more drastic. Both he and the Soviets recognized that the Soviet line had a weakness where it bulged out to defend the city of Kursk, making it an obvious target for the next stage of operations.____________‚ô´ Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4H‚ô´ Outro music provided courtesy of Wargaming!""Reading 'Stars and Stripes'"" by Sergey Khmelevskyhttp://bit.ly/1Oak2wZ",history

daVaEoF5Hrk,    Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One  ,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

daVaEoF5Hrk,    Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One  ,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences.

dXgDm7DnIW8,    Music Art Meditation (2019) - Relax Your Mind and Soul with Art and Music #1  ,"Music Art Meditation provides you with a novel method of meditation to relax your Mind and Soul with Art and Music! Stay focused!Arguably, all music can be said to be useful for Meditation. The styles, cadences, arpeggiations, and rhythms of meditational music for contemplative practices is characteristically different than most other forms of music. Generally speaking, the music is relaxing, lacking definitive rhythms. Meditation and music have been relational partners for centuries. Mellow, repetitive, and redundant sequences of smoothly contoured melodic lines help to relax the mind as arrhythmic tempos do not distract the listener into a beat but rather a flow. Harmonies are often absent unless one accepts the musical nuance of imitation as structured harmony. Meditation music can also include recordings of sounds in the ""natural"" world: rainfall, waterfalls, birds, insects, whales, and others, separately and in synthetic combination.In the recent years, it was scientifically proven that relaxing art techniques combined with music is one of the best ways forward as it guarantees rapid positive results.

Soq4M_hu-Nc,    Aboriginal Art and Music  ,"A quick look at some aboriginal art .. All images taken from google images . The audio is from something called Songs From The Northern Territory 4Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt Artist/Collector: Alice Moyle Label Information: Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD Media Type: CD Year: Recorded 1963; Released 1997 Availability: AIATSIS Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt. The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay (north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer time to decide which words to sing next); c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources at the same time. Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.Manikay.comIt is such a shame that so much aboriginal culture has been lost .. Its good to see that some remains .",art and music

d8VA7_qSC7U,    With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.  ,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff KoonsSomething I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale!

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

OxI6uPQwu8I,    Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom  ,"I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction.
